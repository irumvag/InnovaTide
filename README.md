    ### Getting Started

    1. **Create a Python virtual environment:**
        ```bash
        py -m venv env
        ```

    2. **Activate the environment and install dependencies:**
        - `django`
        - `django-tailwind`
        - `django-bootstrap`

        You can install them using:
        ```bash
        pip install django django-tailwind django-bootstrap
        ```

    3. **Running the Project:**
        - Start the Tailwind development server in one terminal:
          ```bash
          python manage.py tailwind start
          ```
        - In another terminal, run the Django development server:
          ```bash
          python manage.py runserver
          ```

    Make sure both servers are running for full functionality.
